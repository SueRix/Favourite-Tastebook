      "description": "Preheat the oven hard: 250°C (or the hottest setting) for at least 30 minutes; if you have a pizza stone/steel, heat it too.\n1) Dough: mix flour, yeast, warm water, olive oil, and salt until a rough dough forms. Knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic (it should spring back when poked).\n2) First rise: cover and proof 45–60 minutes at room temperature until doubled and airy.\n3) Shape: dust the bench with flour/semolina and gently stretch the dough from the center outward, keeping a thicker rim for the crust. Avoid rolling so you don’t squeeze out all the bubbles.\n4) Top: spread a thin layer of tomato sauce (don’t flood). Add torn mozzarella, a pinch of salt, and a few basil leaves (or add basil after baking for a fresher aroma).\n5) Bake: slide onto the hot stone/steel or a preheated tray. Bake 8–12 minutes until the rim is deeply browned, the cheese bubbles, and the base is crisp. Rest 1–2 minutes, drizzle with olive oil, then slice.",

Drain excess fat if needed.\n3) Deglaze (optional but good): splash in a little water or broth and scrape the pan to lift browned bits.\n4) Simmer: add canned tomatoes and tomato paste; season with salt, black pepper, oregano, and basil.
