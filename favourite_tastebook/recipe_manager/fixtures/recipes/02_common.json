      "title": "Fried Potatoes with Onions",
      "description": "1) Prep: Peel (optional) and cut potatoes into even sticks or thin wedges so they cook at the same rate. Rinse in cold water until the water runs mostly clear to remove excess starch, then drain and dry very well (wet potatoes steam instead of frying).\n2) Slice the onion into thin half-moons. Keep onion separate so it doesn’t burn while potatoes are still raw.\n3) Heat a wide skillet over medium-high heat for 1–2 minutes. Add sunflower oil and let it heat until it shimmers.\n4) Add potatoes in a single layer as much as possible. If the pan is crowded, fry in two batches for better browning.\n5) Fry 4–6 minutes without stirring so a crust forms. Then flip/turn and continue frying, stirring only occasionally. Adjust heat so potatoes brown but do not burn.\n6) When potatoes are mostly tender (a knife goes in with light resistance) and already have golden spots, reduce heat to medium and add the onion.\n7) Continue frying 6–10 minutes, stirring more often now, until onions are soft and golden and potatoes are fully cooked through.\n8) Season near the end: salt + black pepper; add paprika only in the last 1–2 minutes so it doesn’t turn bitter.\n9) Finish: off the heat, add chopped dill. Rest 1–2 minutes (steam settles, crust stays nicer), then serve hot.\nDoneness check: potatoes should be soft inside with browned edges; onions should be sweet and lightly caramelized, not dark-burnt.",

Place it in a cold pan and set to medium heat to render fat gradually.\n2) Fry bacon 4–6 minutes, stirring, until it is browned and crisp at the edges. If there is excessive fat, spoon off a little (leave a thin layer for flavor).\n3) If the pan looks dry, add a small knob of butter; let it melt and foam, but do not brown it aggressively.\n4) Crack eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper and beat just until yolks and whites are combined (do not over-whip).\n5) Lower heat to medium-low. Pour eggs into the pan and wait 10–15 seconds until the edges begin to set.\n6) With a spatula, gently push eggs from the edges to the center, forming soft curds. Keep moving slowly; scrambled eggs cook best with controlled heat.\n7) Stop cooking when eggs are still slightly glossy and soft; they will finish setting from residual heat in 30–60 seconds.\n8) Top with sliced green onion and serve immediately (scrambled eggs lose tenderness if held too long).\nTexture guide: lower heat = creamier curds; higher heat = drier eggs. Aim for “just set” rather than fully firm.",

Add butter and swirl to coat the bottom.\n4) Pour in the egg mixture. Immediately tilt the pan to spread evenly into a thin layer.\n5) After 30–60 seconds, when the edges start setting, use a spatula to gently lift edges and let liquid egg flow underneath for even cooking.\n6) When the surface is mostly set but still slightly moist on top, place chopped tomato and grated cheese on one half.\n7) Reduce heat to low, cover for 30–60 seconds if needed to help cheese melt without over-browning the bottom.\n8) Fold the omelette over the filling. Cook 30–60 seconds more on low heat, just to finish setting.\n9) Rest 1 minute, then serve. Sprinkle with dried basil if desired.\nDoneness check: the omelette should be tender and not dry; cheese should be melted; tomato should be warmed but not boiled to mush.",

Press lightly so the sandwich holds together.\n4) Heat a pan over medium-low to medium heat. Place sandwich in the pan and toast 3–5 minutes until the bottom is golden.\n5) Flip carefully and toast the second side 3–5 minutes. If the bread browns too fast before cheese melts, lower heat and cover the pan for 1–2 minutes.\n6) Remove when both sides are golden and cheese is visibly melted (edges may ooze slightly).\n7) Rest 1 minute so melted cheese thickens slightly, then slice and serve warm.\nControl points: medium-low heat melts cheese evenly; high heat burns bread while cheese stays firm.",

If you need to hold it, store filling and bread separately and assemble right before eating.\nTexture guide: well-drained tuna + moderate mayo = creamy but structured filling that doesn’t leak.",
