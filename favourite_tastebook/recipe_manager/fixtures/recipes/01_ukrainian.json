      "title": "Ukrainian Borscht",
      "description": "Prep notes:\n- Cut vegetables to similar size so they cook evenly. Keep the beet separate so the color stays bright.\n- Use low, gentle simmering for broth; boiling hard makes it cloudy.\n\n1) Make the beef broth:\n   - Put beef in a pot, cover with cold water (about 2–2.5 L for 4–6 servings), and bring to a boil.\n   - Skim off the foam, reduce to a gentle simmer, partially cover, and cook 60–80 minutes until the beef is tender.\n   - (Optional) Remove the beef, slice/shred it, and return it to the pot at the end for clean serving.\n\n2) Add the “base” vegetables:\n   - Peel and dice potatoes (1–2 cm cubes). Shred cabbage thinly.\n   - Add potatoes to the broth; simmer 10 minutes, then add cabbage and simmer another 10–15 minutes (until potatoes are almost tender).\n\n3) Build flavor with the sauté (the key to borscht):\n   - In a skillet, heat sunflower oil over medium heat.\n   - Sauté diced onion and grated carrot 5–7 minutes until soft and lightly golden.\n   - Add grated/julienned beetroot, stir 1–2 minutes, then add tomato paste.\n   - Pour in a small ladle of broth or a splash of water, cover, and stew 10–15 minutes until the beet is tender.\n   - Add 1–2 tsp vinegar near the end (it helps keep the beet red).\n\n4) Combine and balance:\n   - Tip the sauté into the pot. Add bay leaf, salt, black pepper, and a pinch of sugar (to round acidity).\n   - Simmer gently 5–10 minutes so flavors merge. Taste and adjust:\n     • more salt for overall flavor,\n     • a touch more vinegar for brightness,\n     • a little more sugar if it tastes too sharp.\n\n5) Finish and rest (do not skip):\n   - Turn off heat. Add minced garlic and chopped dill.\n   - Cover and let the borscht rest 10–20 minutes; it will thicken slightly and taste more integrated.\n\nServing:\n- Serve hot with sour cream and extra dill. Borscht is often even better the next day after chilling overnight.",

      "title": "Varenyky with Potatoes",
      "description": "1) Make and rest the dough:\n   - In a bowl combine flour, egg, water, and salt. Mix, then knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n   - If sticky, dust with a little flour; if too firm, add a teaspoon of water.\n   - Cover and rest 20 minutes (this relaxes gluten so the dough rolls thin without shrinking).\n\n2) Prepare the potato filling:\n   - Boil peeled potatoes in salted water until very tender. Drain well so the filling is not watery.\n   - Mash with butter until fluffy; season with salt and pepper.\n   - Fry chopped onion in sunflower oil over medium heat until golden (7–10 minutes).\n   - Mix part of the fried onion into the potatoes; keep the rest for serving.\n\n3) Shape the varenyky:\n   - Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to ~2 mm thickness.\n   - Cut circles (7–9 cm). Keep unused dough covered to prevent drying.\n   - Place 1–2 tsp filling in the center. Fold into a half-moon, press edges firmly, then crimp to seal.\n   - Ensure no filling touches the edge; otherwise the seal may open during boiling.\n\n4) Boil correctly (so they don’t burst):\n   - Bring a wide pot of salted water to a gentle boil (not an aggressive rolling boil).\n   - Add varenyky in batches. Stir once carefully to prevent sticking to the bottom.\n   - When they float, simmer 2–3 minutes more until the dough looks slightly translucent and set.\n\n5) Serve:\n   - Remove with a slotted spoon, toss lightly with butter so they don’t stick.\n   - Top with remaining fried onion and serve with sour cream.\n   - Make-ahead: freeze uncooked varenyky on a tray, then bag them; boil from frozen, adding ~1–2 minutes after floating.",

      "title": "Holubtsi (Ukrainian Cabbage Rolls)",
      "description": "Prep notes:\n- The cabbage leaves must be pliable (soft enough to roll) but not falling apart.\n- Keep seams down while cooking so rolls stay closed.\n\n1) Prepare cabbage leaves:\n   - Carefully separate cabbage into whole leaves.\n   - Blanch leaves in boiling water 2–3 minutes (or until flexible). Transfer to a plate to cool.\n   - Trim or gently flatten the thick rib with a knife so the leaf rolls evenly.\n\n2) Par-cook the rice:\n   - Rinse rice until water runs clearer. Cook in lightly salted water until half-done (about 7–10 minutes).\n   - Drain and cool slightly (hot rice can overcook the meat mixture).\n\n3) Make the filling:\n   - Sauté chopped onion and grated carrot in a little sunflower oil until soft (5–7 minutes).\n   - In a bowl combine ground meat + par-cooked rice + sautéed vegetables.\n   - Season with salt and pepper; mix until evenly distributed (don’t overmix or it becomes dense).\n\n4) Roll and arrange:\n   - Place a leaf flat, add 1–2 tbsp filling near the base.\n   - Fold sides inward, then roll tightly into a log.\n   - Arrange in a pot or baking dish seam-side down in snug layers (this prevents unrolling).\n\n5) Make the sauce and cook:\n   - Whisk tomato paste with water (or broth) and sour cream until smooth.\n   - Add minced garlic, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.\n   - Pour sauce over rolls until mostly covered.\n   - Cook either:\n     A) Stovetop: bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook 60–70 minutes on low heat.\n     B) Oven: cover dish with foil and bake ~70–80 minutes at 180°C.\n\n6) Rest and serve:\n   - Let holubtsi rest 10 minutes before serving so juices settle.\n   - Serve with extra sour cream and herbs; spoon sauce over the top.",

      "description": "1) Prepare the potato mixture:\n   - Grate potatoes and onion finely (on the small holes). Onion helps prevent browning.\n   - Squeeze excess liquid through cheesecloth or a clean towel into a bowl.\n   - Let the liquid sit 1–2 minutes; pour off the water and return the settled potato starch to the grated potatoes (it helps bind).\n\n2) Mix the batter:\n   - Add egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix just until combined.\n   - The mixture should be thick enough to hold shape in the pan; add a little more flour only if it’s too runny.\n\n3) Fry for crisp edges and a cooked center:\n   - Heat sunflower oil in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat.\n   - Spoon small pancakes (they cook through more reliably than large ones).\n   - Fry 3–4 minutes per side until deep golden. If they brown too fast, lower heat.\n\n4) Drain and keep warm:\n   - Transfer to paper towels to remove excess oil.\n   - Keep warm in a low oven (90–110°C) if frying in batches.\n\nServing:\n- Serve hot with sour cream and dill. Optional: add minced garlic to sour cream for a sharper sauce.",

      "title": "Chicken Kyiv",
      "description": "Prep notes:\n- Cold butter + tight sealing = butter stays inside instead of leaking.\n- Double breading helps create a “barrier” against leaks.\n\n1) Prepare the herb butter:\n   - Mix softened butter with minced garlic and chopped parsley.\n   - Shape into a small log (about finger-thick), wrap, and chill or freeze until very firm.\n\n2) Prepare the chicken:\n   - Place chicken breast between film and pound gently to an even thickness (about 0.7–1 cm).\n   - Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n\n3) Wrap and seal:\n   - Place butter log near the center.\n   - Fold sides over butter, then roll very tightly into a cylinder.\n   - Pinch seams and ends closed. Chill 15–30 minutes to firm up.\n\n4) Bread properly:\n   - Dredge in flour (shake off excess) → dip in beaten egg → coat in breadcrumbs.\n   - For a thicker crust: repeat egg → breadcrumbs once more.\n   - Chill again 10 minutes so the coating adheres.\n\n5) Cook through without burning:\n   - Fry in oil over medium heat until evenly golden on all sides (about 5–7 minutes total, turning gently).\n   - Transfer to oven at 180°C for 10–12 minutes to finish (or until chicken is fully cooked).\n   - Rest 5 minutes before cutting; slicing immediately increases butter leakage.\n\nServing:\n- Slice to show the butter center. Serve with mashed potatoes, rice, or a simple salad.",
